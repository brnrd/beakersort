# beakersort

Implementation of quite possibly the most inefficient sorting algorithm ever

Beakersort is simple: swap two items at random until the list is sorted. Here it is, implemented in Python, PHP, and JavaScript.

Each one is written as a command-line utility that will sort its integer arguments in ascending order.

```
$ ./beakersort.js 5 3 2 4 1
1 2 3 4 5
```
